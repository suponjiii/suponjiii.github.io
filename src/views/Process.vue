            Ideally, it'd be prior to recording any lines - The mixing process
            starts with recording and I'd like us to be on the same page on how
            you want it to sound!

        If I accept, you can go ahead and record or give me the lines if you
        have already recorded. Refer to the
        <router-link to="/line-guidelines">guidelines</router-link> to minimize
        any additional work for me! <br />
        If the lines don't conform to those guidelines and you are unable to fix
        the issues, I will charge extra!

        I will send an invoice with a partial payment before I start. Upon

      <li>
        I’ll send you in a Critmix (preview-quality) in which I have done most
        of the things...In that mix, you can tell me which things to change
        (Volumes, effects, timing, everything basically)
